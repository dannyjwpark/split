.split() is a clone of [Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com/), an interpersonal finance app that allows consumers to split expenses with friends. If a group needs to share the cost of a particular bill, .split() ensures that anyone who pays is reimbursed the correct amount and with a minimal number of transactions.
